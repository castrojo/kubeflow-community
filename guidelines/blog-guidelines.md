### Blog Guidelines

#### Suitable content:

- **Original content only**
- Kubeflow project release information
- Topics related to participation in or results of working group activities
- Tutorials and demos
- Use cases
- Content that is specific to a vendor or platform about Kubeflow installation and use

#### Unsuitable Content:
- Content that does not address Kubeflow in any way
- Content that doesn't interact with Kubeflow APIs, interfaces, or other technology owned by Kubeflow Working Groups
- Vendor pitches
  - Submissions must contain content that applies broadly to the Kubeflow Community, for example a submission should focus on upstream Kubeflow as opposed to vendor-specific configurations.
  - Links should primarily be to the official Kubeflow documentation and other project properties. When using external references, links should be diverse.

## Review Process

After a blog post is submitted as a PR, it is automatically assigned to a reviewer.

Each blog post requires a `lgtm` label from at least one person in the editorial team.
Once the necessary labels are in place, one of the reviewers will add an `approved` label, and schedule publication of the blog post.

### Service level agreement (SLA)

Blog posts can take up to **1 week** to review.
If you'd like to request an expedited review, please say so on your message when you ping the editorial team on Slack.

## Submit a Post

Anyone can write a blog post and submit it for review. 
Commercial content is not allowed.
Please refer to the guidelines at the top of this document for more guidance.
